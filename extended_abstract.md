#### Abstract
In the real world, networks that can be represented as graphs are very dynamic. They often change according to a pattern. Edge weights representing these networks might shift, but it is entirely possible that edges are added and removed at random due to unforeseen circumstances. For a graph, when trying to compute the shortest path from a source to a destination in a setting where edge weights change with respect to time, it's important to not only consider current edge weights, but what future edge weights are predicted to be. For this project specifically, I'll be creating a framework for a data-based single-agent optimal routing technique.
